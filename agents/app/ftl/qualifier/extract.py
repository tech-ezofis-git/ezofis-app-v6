"""
RFQ input extraction for the Qualifier agent: turns a raw upload (.eml, or a bare PDF/DOCX spec)
into (a) email metadata if present, and (b) a *shrunk* candidate text — not the full 40-120+ page
tender document — built from deterministic, code-level section targeting.

Why this exists at all, rather than just handing the whole document to the model: the Qualifier
runs on a nano-tier model over documents that regularly run 100+ pages. Section targeting is a
hard, code-level step (same philosophy as chat_agent_retrieval.py's price-redaction backstop —
don't rely on the model alone for something code can do reliably), grounded in the real RFQ
samples: consultant modernization tenders consistently split into three linked spec sections
(commonly numbered 14000/14100/14900) with a recurring, nameable set of FTL-relevant subsections
(Governor & Governor Ropes, Counterweight Guides, Hall Door Equipment, Car Roller Guides, Door
Operators, Door Protective Device, Car Door Clutch, Car Safeties) plus a bidder equipment-manifest
questionnaire. New-construction tenders use a different, single-spec PART 1/2/3 template covering
the whole elevator — that structural difference is itself extracted as a signal.

Also extracted: a "Device count / schedule summary" (how many cars/elevators the tender covers —
useful context for sizing a project even though the Qualifier doesn't compute quantities), and the
"Description/Schedule of Existing Equipment" table and the numbered "New Equipment" scope checklist
— both ported over from auditing the separate Quote Estimator project against real quotes. The
checklist matters here too: a category can appear ONLY in that bare numbered list with no
elaborated prose subsection anywhere else in the spec (a real sample never described "Car Door
Equipment" outside of it), so without capturing it the Qualifier could under-count in-scope
categories purely because nothing else in the document happens to name them.

This is a v1 heuristic tuned against a handful of real samples, not a general-purpose document
parser — expect to tune the patterns further against real production traffic.
